For example, I just used ChatGPT to figure out a good way to develop a system centered around a graph database, and settled on a docker instance running neo4j. Sometimes these processes require merely describing my intentions and knowledge gaps and asking follow-up questions. On some occasions, when trying to vet a novel concept, it requires uploading pdfs, providing urls, and otherwise convincing ChatGPT that what I want to do makes logical sense.

 - I don’t manually write trivial constructions as much anymore. Instead I get copilot to do things like “loop over the results to create a map from record ids to <value>,” anything like that I usually turn to the assistant to write. I will then have to read the code, potentially modify it or ask for a revision, and run a few manual tests. The style of the generated code is important to me, so I might suggest briefly how I want the code to be implemented.

 - For config files and boilerplate for starting projects, I love using ChatGPT to draft an initial version. These things have always amounted to a process of copy+pasting from a reference and then modifying to suit. ChatGPT can usually give me something tailored from the get-go, and can explain all of the details as needed. A barrier to this is when working with proprietary, non-public frameworks that were not in the training data. For those I have to do the familiar earlier method.

- Error messages — I like to copy + paste error messages into ChatGPT. Especially when they relate to some underlying system or installation incompatibility. These are things I used to google about and search GitHub issues for tips around. ChatGPT usually has the relevant knowledge to explain these problems and suggest a fix. It saves a lot of the frustration around things that are ordinary matters to know about on the one-time basis and are apart from the code itself.

 - When unit testing in very large files with lots of mocks, I find that tools like copilot aren’t always as helpful. Something between the brittle nature of mutation assumptions in the mocks, the very large context windows of unit test files, and the relative uniqueness and newness of the unit test frameworks (maybe not much training data) means I still write a lot of unit tests myself. But once I have a few good examples of how a particular module’s unit tests should be, I can use those examples and specify a new case or cases to test, and then I can rapidly multiply my earlier efforts towards 100% coverage.

 - Refactoring is still something I do manually. And I do a lot of refactoring. I don’t like the prevailing style of Python programs (large functions, loops with lots of code in them, modules with lots of mutation), so I often find myself taking generated code and turning it into smaller functions. When working in JavaScript and TypeScript in an established code base, I use my own judgement to see where I can make smaller functions and smoothen things out. This might mean I don’t trust the models as much with organizing code for larger projects. I’m not sure how much this is due to my own bias, vs models not doing as well across multiple files, vs models not doing as well on messier code with complex logic.

- Manually refactoring generated large functions into smaller ones is a great way to test generated code logic. Sometimes it’s better to treat the generated code as a sketch that can be tested and massaged into working, rather than as something likely to be correct. Particularly with more algorithmic code.

 - When something isn’t working with code that is more algorithmic, I like to ask the LLM why it isn’t, with or without providing example outputs. This works well sometimes but not others.

 - Explanations - when some code is opaque, I will ask things like what it’s for, or I’ll start a comment explaining the code and get copilot to incrementally complete the comment. Sometimes this gives insight but it is almost never something I want to commit to the project without edits.","['Speed_up_testing', 'Challenging_outside_training_data', 'Project_configuration', 'Library_or_dependency_management', 'Code_generation', 'Ask_AI_instead_of_web_search', 'Saves_time_or_boosts_productivity', 'Choosing_software_components', 'Test_Case_Generation', 'Refactor_AI_generated_code', 'Iterative_prompting_process', 'Code_explanation', 'Write_boilerplate_code', 'Verification_of_AI_Generated_Code', 'Provide_a_starting_point', 'Collaboration_or_ideation_partner']",Use regularly,Use occasionally,Heard of it but don't use,Never heard of it,Use regularly,Heard of it but don't use,Never heard of it,"Example inputs and expected outputs,Specific libraries or frameworks to use,Implementation alternatives to consider or avoid,Target environment or deployment constraints,Description of existing codebase architecture,Desired code style and naming conventions",,,,,,,"Code to be tested with specifications,Edge cases and expected behaviors,Testing framework preferences and assertion styles,Existing test suite examples",,"I most often work iteratively, developing one test at a time for a specific scenario, or developing a few lines of code at a time.
